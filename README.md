# Gcd Graphs over Function Fields

This Git repository contains the code we wrote in order to generate and conduct experiments with gcd-graphs over function fields, as discussed in our paper:

**[1]** Ján Mináč, Duy Tan Nguyen, Tung T. Nguyen, *On the gcd graphs over the polynomial ring and related topics* (preprint, 2024).

## Description

Our code uses the SageMath 9.4 kernel and the Python library NetworkX. It includes functions for constructing gcd-graphs and finding cycles on them.
